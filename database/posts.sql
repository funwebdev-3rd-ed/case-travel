I was all prepared for winter and cold … it was to Canada after all that I was travelling! Imagine my surprise when I arrived at the airport on Saturday morning to find the temperature was over 10 degrees Celsius. Yet within just a few hours, the weather began to turn. On Sunday morning, I awoke at 6am local time to find that the city was dusted in about 10cm of snow. <p>It was truly magical! A hush had descended upon the city to go with the snow. And yet, again, to my surprise, there were joggers out at 7am running, snow or no snow. None the less, I spent almost two hours walking all across the center of the city, snapping photos, glad that I had packed mittens and a hat.','2011-12-04 00:00:00'),(2,1,1,'Fall Colors in Calgary','As part of John and I\'s journey across Canada, we found ourselves finally leaving the prairies and heading to Calgary, one of Canada\'s major cities, which lies less than an hour\'s drive from the mountains.<p>The weather was tremendous. Fall colors had blanketing the city, though there still was plenty of green. Perhaps my favorite photo location was Edworthy Park in Calgary. This park is on the western edge of the city right beside the Bow River. The park is also bordered by hills that contain what are amounts to old-growth forests.<p>Evidently the park used to be part of a ranch with cows and horses. While we didn\'t see any domestic animals, there were a variety of wonderful trails meandering through the hills, from which I snapped these photos.','2011-10-08 00:00:00'),(3,5,5,'Mountain Climbing','The highlight of our last trip to Canada was a climb up Sulpher Mountain just outside of Banff. I\'d like to say that it was so difficult that we required crampons, pitons, and screamers … but that would be stretching the truth for sure.<p>The ascent up Sulpher Mountain in fact can be made via a gondola. We decided to walk instead, which took us just about 90 minutes, if I remember correctly. There were lots of other people making the same ascent. Most of the climb is a series of eventually tedious switchbacks.

They are the only whales regularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod\'s side; and as we may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the deck:&mdash;where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale\'s which the Right Whale\'s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale\'s head. As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what the fishermen technically call a \"grey-headed whale.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads&mdash;namely, the two most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale\'s jaw, if you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would fancy to be a young colt\'s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head.</p>','2013-07-09 00:00:00'),(21,17,52,'When in Rome','<p>The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of this whale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage&mdash;a sort of Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. The Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.</p>','2013-08-06 00:00:00'),(22,4,57,'The Park','<p>A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then&mdash;except after explanation&mdash;that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer.</p>','2013-03-10 00:00:00'),(23,22,58,'Florence Tour','<p>I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I\'ll blow the fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. \"A flaw!\" rejecting the last one. \"Work that over again, Perth.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then, with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.</p>','2013-04-18 00:00:00'),(24,12,61,'Architecture of Florence','<p>Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man\'s and every being\'s face. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing fable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the simplest peasant\'s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale\'s brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you can.</p>\n\n<p>If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.</p>','2013-02-12 00:00:00'),(25,15,64,'Tilting in Pisa','<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.</p>\n\n<p>No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</p>\n\n<p>To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside.</p>\n\n<p>It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage&mdash;beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,&mdash;poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say, \"Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.\"</p>\n\n<p>As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck&mdash;now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.</p>\n\n<p>But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about him,&mdash;\"Captain Bildad&mdash;come, old shipmate, we must go.
